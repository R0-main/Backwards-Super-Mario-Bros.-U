- Added solid blocks on 7-3 on some places to make it possible backwards, even if the player don't have Acorn.
- Added solid blocks for wall-jumping on on some areas on 5-Ghost and 7-Ghost to make it possible backwards.
- Added solid blocks on the second (first backwards) part of 7-Airship to make this section possible backwards without the motion controls platform. (Maybe it will be updated on the future).

- Blocked the access to 1-2, 5-Ghost and 7-Ghost Regular Exit until other levels are done backwards.
