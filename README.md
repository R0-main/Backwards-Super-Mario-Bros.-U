# Backwards Super Mario Bros. U

![logo](https://i.goopics.net/75PKm.png)

## Introduction

*Backwards Super Mario Bros. U* is a "full" modification of *New Super Mario Bros. U*, I got this idea from [Nathaniel Bandy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRwczJ_nk1t9IGHyHfHbXRQ)'s videos about *New Super Luigi U Backwards* on his *Backwards series* so I was thinking "Why not doing the same thing for nsmbu ?". By the way the mod *NSLU Backwards* was done by [MayroSMM](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCumgUoIV9t2aGtaQXmwXIAg) so I got the inspiration from these both cool peoples!

## Concept

The concept of this hack is simple, all levels are the "same" levels than the original game except one thing : You start at the end of the stage and you must go back to the begining to clear the level. The flagpole is unreachable due to a giant wall of blocks and the only way is enter to a pipe at the begining to go to the end directly.

## Game content/features

When it completely finished the game will contain : 

- All levels modified to make it possible backwards. Some levels will be more modified than others, it depends of the level !
- Time limits for almost all levels reduced for more challenge.
- No checkpoint flags.
- (Planned) Mid-bosses, Koopalings, Bowser Jr. fights, final boss more harder
- (Planned) Custom levels/World names.

## Tools used on this hack

 - Level edition : [Miyamoto v26.0](https://github.com/aboood40091/Miyamoto/releases) by AboodXD
 - Text edition : [Kuriimu](https://github.com/IcySon55/Kuriimu/releases) by IcySon55

## FAQ

**Q : When the first version is released, the full game can be played ?**

A : No, When the first version cames out, only the levels to beat the game in the fastest way can be played (for a total of 22 levels), so some exits will be blocked until new levels are done backwards. But on each update, more levels are added to the hack, so keep an eye to this project ! (You can watch the hack on GitHub to recieve notifications when a new update is ready)
